# Game-of-Clans
We all obviosuly know that we should not bring logics in database:)) but in this game we were told to do this!!
There are some clans attacking to each other based on amount of their stored food, golds, wood and soldiers. You can see ranking of their wins and their experiences. All the actions take place with database stored procedures! Also there is a simple graphical user interface.
